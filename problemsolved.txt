Hey
It's book of my past knowledge! :)


[1]
	Here was problem with "
	async def goods(request):
	data = await request.post()
	'''
	if data:
		item = data['item']
		todb = input_analyzer.analyzer(item)
	'''
	without 'if data' statement my app does sometimes work and sometimes not
	How i solved? Here's my theory:
	asynchronous code have been trying to do next steps when request.post was in infinite awaiting
	so that's why I've seen an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
